\maketitle

\section*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I see the Summer of Science project as an opportunity to gain insights into the way research is done and how material is presented and organised, while learning new skills and knowledge of Cryptography.
    \item Particularly, in relation to the topic, I want to dive deep into the prospects of Quantum Cryptography, the work that is done by Scientists till now and all that can possibly be done in the future.
    \item I want to familiarise myself with the evolving Quantum technology  and gain insights into how Mathematics can be used to incorporate it with Cryptography.
    \item In the end, it's all to fulfill my curiosity and explore the horizons of Science.
\end{itemize}
